# SkiAdvisor
Java App to save Ski Area information to SQL database.

This project was part of Database class. The app runs on terminal and prompts the user what they would like to do. 
It saves then user data to the database that was created.

Possible user options include:
* Create user
* See all info of Ski Resorts
* Give a rating for a Ski Resort
* See ratings for a specific Ski Area 
* Searh users
* Delete user

During this project I created a deeper understanding of databases and how to implement database to Java code. 
In addition I challenged my creativity by coming up with an app idea that I was personally passionate about and that would be useful to others.
As I worked on the project alone, it tested my coding abilities and highlighted the crucial details involved in connecting code to a database. 
In general building SkiAdvisor made me get a better understanding of computer systems and it improved my Java and SQL knowledge.
